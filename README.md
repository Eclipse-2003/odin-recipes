# odin-recipes

This project is a brief introduction into HTML and setting up a basic webpage. This particular project includes a list of recipes on the main index.html page, which will each link to a new page with that particular recipe. 

There are 3 recipes on different HTML pages, under the recipes folder. those recipes include beef-bowl.html, chicken-parm.html, and pizza-crust.html. 

This project uses only HTML and little use of CSS. Some skills used in this project include: the use of git, git staging and commits, webpage linking and saftey attributes, images and attributes, and various html elements including lists, paragraphs, and headings. CSS was added onto this project as a later assigment to give these pages more character.
